#### 4. **Care and Maintenance**
- **Cleaning**: 
  - Hand wash only. Avoid using the dishwasher as it may affect the non-stick coating.
  - After use, allow the pan to cool before washing to prevent thermal shock.
  - Use a soft sponge or cloth with mild dish soap. Avoid abrasive cleaners and scouring pads.
  - If food sticks to the surface, soak the pan in warm, soapy water for a few minutes before cleaning.

- **Re-seasoning**: Over time, the non-stick coating might wear off. To maintain the pan's performance:
  - Repeat the seasoning process mentioned earlier whenever you notice food starting to stick.

- **Storage**:
  - Store the pan in a dry place to prevent rust.
  - If stacking with other cookware, place a soft cloth or paper towel between them to protect the surface.
